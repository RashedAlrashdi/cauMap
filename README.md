# Cau Map
This was my graduation project. My colleague and I decided to revamp Clark Atlanta University app.
Technologies we used for the project are, Ionic and Angular frameworks which allow us to utilize JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Since I have an experience with ArcGIS pro from GIS class I took a year before my graduation.
My job was creating a map for CAU that shows its buildings. The user can navigate and choose which bulding they wish to go, and it should take them there.
The idea was that new students could get to their classes faster.
