# Cau Map
This was my graduation project. My colleuge and I decided to revmap Clark Atlanta University app.
We used Ionic and Angular frameworks for the project. Since I have an experience with ArcGIS pro from GIS class I took before.
My job was to create a map for CAU that shows its buildings. The user can navigate and choose which bulding they wish to go, and it should take them there.
The idea is that new students could get to their classes faster.
